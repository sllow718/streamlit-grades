    1. **Navigate Pages**:
       - Use the sidebar menu to switch between **Upload** and **Filter** pages.
       - Select "upload_page" to upload a CSV file.
       - Select "filter_page" to filter and view the data.
    
    2. **Upload Page**:
       - Upload a CSV file (e.g., a grades dataset) using the file uploader.
       - View a preview of the first 5 rows, dataset info, and column names.
       - Click "Go to Filter Page" to proceed to filtering.
    
    3. **Filter Page**:
       - Filter data by section codes (last 4 characters of the "Sections" column).
       - Select columns to display in the filtered data table.
       - View filter statistics (row count, selected section codes, selected columns).
       - Click "Back to Upload Page" to upload a new file.
    
    **Note**: Ensure a CSV file is uploaded on the Upload page before using the Filter page, or youâ€™ll see an error prompting you to upload a file.
